# Restaurant Sales Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning raw restaurant sales data and performing feature engineering to prepare the dataset for effective analysis and visualization.

The raw dataset was unstructured and required multiple transformations to make it analysis-ready. The final output can be directly used in Excel, Power BI, or any BI tool for dashboard creation.
